This is a significant rewrite of ysdragons streambot for personal use cases (https://github.com/ysdragon/StreamBot)
the removal of youtube/linked media into more of a local media playbot that automatically joins, plays content on shuffle and leaves when noone is present in a discord channel.

todo:
fucking everything :|

working:
autojoin specified channel, play media on shuffle and leave channel on media file end if no users are present in channel
